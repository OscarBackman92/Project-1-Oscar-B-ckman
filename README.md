Welcome,

This is my "Imaginary Breakfast Foodtruck!

The idea is to make a site for a foodtruck that serves breakfast to commuters daylie at a trainstation or busstop.

I added the starter Boilerplate code using emmet, for speed.
Added favicon as my first move together with some header and body content.

added nav toggle and menus
placed the footer on the bottom of the page so main content took avalible space.
Added google fonts
Tested the HTML code in Validator v3
added background image
added dropdown icon to menu
